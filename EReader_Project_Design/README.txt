E-Reader Project Design

	This project was developed as a prospective programming assignment for students
in a CSc 335 class at the University of Arizona (Object Oriented Programming
and Design). This was completed as part of a Creative Project Presentation
assignment in Section Leader Training (CSc 391) at the University of Arizona,
overseen by Dr. Lester McCann.

	Included in the top-level folder is a Project Abstract (Abstract.pdf) for
educators, a Project Specification (Project_Spec.pdf) for students, and a
sample implementation.
